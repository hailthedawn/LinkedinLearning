Things I picked up on from errors:
1) Objects are not valid as a React child. To render an object eg- state, an array needs to be used.
2) Global variables inside classes are dynamically bound. Trying to access "this.state" when there was no global variable called state did not result in a syntax error (nothing was displayed though). However, nonexistent function arguments throw a syntax error when lookup is attempted.
